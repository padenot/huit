This program is a free software VST bitcrusher/downsampler, licensed
under the New BSD License terms.

A binary is provided for quick testing, and the programs is meant to be
built using Visual Studio, for the moment. Expect this to change in a
near future. I will probably use a SCons based build, and leave Visual
Studio for a free software compiler and IDE.

For the moment, no GUI is provided, and the rendering of the parameters
is done by the host.

This code has been tested using Reaper, a marvelous piece of software.
